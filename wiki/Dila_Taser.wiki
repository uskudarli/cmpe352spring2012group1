#summary Info about Dila Taşer

= Info =

I'm a junior student at Boğaziçi University, CMPE department. Becoming a computer engineering was a dream of mine since my early childhood, although I didn't exactly know what I was going to face when I get into the department, probably was dreaming of inventing new technologies :)

If it wasn't this hard in this university, I definitely would enjoy it much more, and if I was a bit successful I wouldn't have lost all my self confidence which I had before :P

Because I'm not a very hardworking person and basically I suck at time management, I sometimes lose my belief in life when on midterm-project-final periods. But I can say when I take the responsibility of something, I try my best, although I sometimes fail at the end :/

Besides these, I like painting and cooking, especially desserts, and I love trying different flavors each time, not like revani or regular cake, but like nanaimo bars and welsh cake :)
