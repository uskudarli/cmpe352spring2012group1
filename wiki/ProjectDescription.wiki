#summary General description of of our project

=Social Services Community=

Social credit based service communities aim to exchange services within a community. 

Our project is a Java-based Social Services Community program which provides means for publishing services that can be offered and those that are desired. Such a system could be used by a physical neighborhood or a virtual online community.

In our project we are supposed to build a Web based system, which will support:
  * Definition of service offers and request
  * Service matching (find a person who has offered a given kind of service)
  * Searching for services
  * Browsing services
  * Providing social credit for services
  * Means for rating those who provide and get services
  * Equitable distribution of services (all community members should be able to offer services, new comers should be encouraged to provide services)
  * Location based services (physical proximity often is a better choice for some types of services)
  * Virtual services (i.e. translation services)
  * Displaying recent activities to promote this system
  * Create a social network an perform social network analysis in order to evaluate the application success

This project will be built with Java and hosted with Tomcat. Also the code will be open source, accessible from Google Code.
