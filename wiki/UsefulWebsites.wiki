#summary Research about the project domain and similar projects

= What is "Social Services Community"? =

  The social services community offers individuals the opportunity to share skills and needs, to help themselves while helping others. For example, tutoring can be offered to a teenager who in turn takes care of the tutor’s pet. The main principles of matching people are reciprocity and equality. For such a system to work all members of the community should provide and consume services. Every individual can supply useful services.The service exchange not only complements existing services but also promotes self-sufficiency and connection inside community. On the other hand criminal backgrounds, prejudice and satisfaction can cause problems.

  * Local exchange trading systems (LETS) are not-for-profit community enterprises that provide a community information service and record transactions of members exchanging "goods and services" by using the currency of locally created "LETS Credits". Means for crediting and rating as well as encouragement of community members are central to our project. Therefore, it is worth further investigating the following links.

 * During my research on the web I encountered projects similar to ours. I want to mention two of them. The first one is [http://bcn.boulder.co.us/community/servexchange/ The Service Exchange of Boulder Country]. The idea of meeting each other’s need is the same. However their principle depends solely on a written membership agreement rather than a web-based system.

   The second one is quoted from a continuing brainstorm on the future          of cities and published on the webpage of a US based company called [http://www.good.is/post/ideas-for-cities-diy-city/ GOOD]. It is suggested that cities would extend [http://seeclickfix.com/citizens this] to a trade platform for services. This model is able to display recent activities and allow some kind of rating system as in the requirements of our project. As a result all citizens would have a complete profile of their skills, experience, and contributions in a Facebook-like citizen social network paired with opportunity matching.

  * There are similar projects to the one we are supposed to work on, "Social Services Community". Some are similar in the way of exchanging services, some are in terms of being nonprofit organizations, and some in terms of establishing a network between members. We need to combine these in order to fulfil our requirements.

  # http://yapanzi.com/ is a website that provides getting or offering services that are splitted into categories, can be searched, rated etc.
  # http://www.service-network.co.uk/ Service Network, the voice of the service sector in the North East of England, brings together the best of the corporate world and vibrant smaller businesses, all focussed on delivering high value, business to business services. Our members are talented, driven individuals and companies looking for opportunities to exchange best practice, learn, move their business forward, and collaborate.
  # http://meetup.com/ is a network of local groups. Meetup makes it easy for anyone to organize a local group or find one of the thousands already meeting up face-to-face.
