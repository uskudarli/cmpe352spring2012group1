= Scenario 1 =
==User offers a new service & is looking to broadcast / socialize ==

Ali who is a student in CMPE department, decides to enter the social services community.

He first registers to the website and then creates himself a profile. 

He enriches his profile by adding his photos and personal information.

He also provides links from his Facebook page to add up more information about himself.

Then he decides to serve the community within his programming skills. 

So he submits his offer describing his skills in great detail and also shares a document including the projects that he has been accomplished so far.

He adds “computer”, “programming” and “software” tags to his service so that it would be easier for others to find it.

To be able to set the price for his service Ali checks the system database and reviews similar services offered by others. 

He sees Ayşe a junior student offering programming service for 50 credits and a senior Veli offering the same service for 60 credits. 

So Ali decides on the price of 55 credits and finally publishes his own service.

Then the programming service of the Ali is listed in the list of recent activities.

After offering a service, Ali decides to take a look at the services offered by others and tries to see if there are services and members he might be interested in.

Ali’s flat has a problematic electric network and it usually breaks down. So Ali becomes really happy when he finds Mehmet Bey who is an electrician and offers fixing minor electricity problems for relatively cheap prices. 

Ali then starts to follow Mehmet Bey on the online services community in case he might have a problem with electricity of his flat.

Ali then takes a look on the forum of the social network and reads topics related to the programming service that he is giving.

He also takes a look on other topics mostly opened by electricians, keeping in mind that he may need an electrician one day.

= Scenario 2 =
==A user is looking for a specific service. He cannot find what he is looking for. He then decides to look for a slightly different service and finds many. He compares them and chooses one among them. He is matched with the service provider==

Ayşe, who is 13 years old, really likes apple pie. 

One day when she arrives home after school, she feels really hungry and realizes that her mother is at work and forgot to make apple pie for her.

Therefore, she logs into the social services community and tries to find out a person who offers cooking apple pie, so that she could end her hunger. 

She searches for “apple pie” but she can’t find any. 

Then she types only “pie” to the search bar and finds nothing again. 

However when she searches for “apple”, she finds many people offering apple cookies.

Then Ayşe, lists the search results (services offered) with respect to their location.

Being in the same neighborhood is the most important criterion for her since she is too hungry. 

Therefore she decides to request the service whose server is closest and available. 

Ayşe requests the service from Handan Hanım who lives in the next apartment by indicating the time as ‘now’.

Handan Hanım receives the request and calls Ayşe to understand how many cookies Ayşe needs. 

Then they agree on 5 cookies and Ayşe accepts to pay 5credits for such a service.

Handan Hanım also approves the request and starts to cook apple cookies.

After 30minutes Handan Hanım brings cookies to Ayşe.

Ayşe eats the cookies and really likes them. She again logs into the social services community system and ranks the service of Handan Hanım with maximum points.

Since the service has been accomplished, Handan Hanım receives 5 credits from Ayşe’s account.
