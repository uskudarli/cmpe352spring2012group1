#summary Info about Arif Murat Yağcı

= Info =

I am a grad student who has to take this course but it seems to be well worth it especially when Suzan Hoca is lecturing it. I have some experience as a developer. I implemented machine learning and computer vision algorithms before in industrial and academic settings as well as some database-driven projects, but I have limited experience in web-based design and development.

Regarding the project, I have familiarity with Java and MySQL. I also have a few servers incl. tomcat running for experimental purposes on my Linux machine. 

I think, I am a science and technology geek. Apart from this fact, some other pointers about me are:  I have a small collection of musical instruments and a huge collection of books. I also like trekking in nature.
