#summary Info about Arif Murat Yağcı

= Info =

I am a grad student. I have some experience as a developer. I implemented machine learning and computer vision algorithms before using C++ and Java, but I have very limited experience in web-based design and development.

Regarding the project, I have familiarity with Java and MySQL. I also have a few servers incl. tomcat running for experimental purposes on my Linux machine. Though, I am no pro at any of these.
