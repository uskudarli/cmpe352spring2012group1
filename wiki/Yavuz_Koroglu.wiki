* I have experience with stand-alone java applications, but no experience with internet services whatsoever. Also I don't have any experience in teamwork. I am experienced in writing matching/searching algorithms, I wrote many word correction and unit-ability matcher algorithms, so I may have useful ideas in user-service matching algorithm in this project.*
