# Info #

I'm a senior expecting to graduate in Jan 2013 since I became an irregular student after spending last Spring semester in Utrecht University, Netherlands. I'm familiar with most of the common programming languages and I have been doing a summer internship on DWH & Reporting. I am not willing to build a career upon software development and I would be much more willing to contribute research and analysis parts of the project.
On the other hand, I support Fenerbahçe and I really like playing & watching football. I also like swimming and playing card games especially bridge.
