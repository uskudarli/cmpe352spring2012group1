# Info #

I am a junior student in CMPE. I spent last semester at TU München as an exchange student. Actually I had no idea about computer engineering when I first came here. But now I am glad to be a student at Boğaziçi. I am much more interested in design and management of technology. I really want to be a Googler on some day.

I am obsessed with odd numbers. Also I am keen on cars and advertisements. When I was in high school, I was interested in fencing. Recently I try to learn sailing. I hate cooking but I like eating. And I am good at cleaning. So, if somebody cooks, then I can offer cleaning service in exchange :)
