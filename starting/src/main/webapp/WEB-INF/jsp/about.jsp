<h4>1. Why is there a platform like this?<br></h4>
<b>Because these are familiar to all of us. We need each other.</b><br>
<ul>
<li>"I am studying for GRE nowadays. If I could take advice from someone who took the exam before, I would be more successful."</li>
<li>"I don't have any time to do all my work by myself. Days are too short and  I have lots of things to do.."</li>
<li>"I want to have different hobbies, but it would have been awesome if I could try different things before decision."</li>
</ul>
<b>But it is hard to ask for help.</b><br>
<ul>
<li>"I need help most of the time. But everybody is so busy. Who can I ask for help?"</li>
<li>"I give up asking for help since I cannot pay for the help I got."</li>
</ul>
<b>We like helping each other but the problem is that we don't know how.</b><br>
<li>"I love helping others. Feeling useful, serviceable gives happiness!"</li>
<li>"Actually I am not sure about how I can help others. If I could have seen othersâ€™ needs, there would absolutely be something that I could do."</li>
<br>
<b>A platform that brings people who need help and want to help and simplifies giving the reward for it is required.</b><br>
</ul>
